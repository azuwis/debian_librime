Description: Rime Input Method Engine - core library
 RIME is the acronym of Rime Input Method Engine.
 .
 RIME is a lightweight, extensible input method engine supporting various input
 schematas including glyph-based input methods, romanization-based input methods
 as well as those for Chinese dialects. It has the ability to compose phrases
 and sentences intelligently and provide very accurate traditional Chinese
 output. RIME's cross-platform core library is written in C++, and can work
 consistently on different platforms with OS-specific wrappers.
 .
 This package provides the core library of RIME.
